# backup.agent — Overview

## What this is

`backup.agent` is a Go binary a customer installs on any machine — Windows, Linux,
or macOS, on our IAAS fleet or entirely elsewhere — to back up files or the output
of a script (e.g. a `mysqldump` wrapper) to this account's dedicated bucket in our
own multi-tenant S3 service.

It is **not** a replacement for the existing hypervisor-level VM backup system
(`NextDeveloper\IAAS` — `BackupJobs`/`VirtualMachineBackups`, XenServer snapshot +
export, no in-guest agent). That system answers "recover the whole VM." This one
answers "recover this database" or "recover these files," including on machines we
don't host at all.

## Why this design

Backup-tool research converged on one theme: **silent failure is the dominant
failure mode** — industry surveys cite roughly half of restores failing in
practice, with jobs reporting "success" against unusable or corrupted data.
Homegrown backup formats (chunking, dedup, encryption, incremental snapshots) are
a major contributor — mature tools get this right after years of edge cases;
reinventing it is where the risk concentrates. Backup repositories are also now a
primary ransomware target, making immutability non-negotiable.

Given that, three decisions shape everything below:

- **Engine: Kopia**, embedded as a Go library. Content-defined chunking, dedup,
  encryption, incremental snapshots, and a native S3-compatible repository
  backend — all things a from-scratch engine would have to re-derive.
- **Target: our own S3 service only.** Every agent gets one dedicated bucket +
  scoped IAM key, so we can apply the WORM/Object Lock immutability and quota
  infrastructure that already exists in this package, rather than supporting
  arbitrary external S3 endpoints.
- **Missed backups are surfaced, not inferred.** A job's outcome is recorded
  explicitly in `s3_backup_job_runs` every time it runs; a job that stops
  reporting completions gets escalated by `s3:backup-agents-check-missed`
  even while the agent's heartbeat looks perfectly healthy.

## House pattern this plugs into

The platform already runs a generic multi-tenant agent architecture over NATS
JetStream (`plusclouds.api.v4/docs/agents/{overview,protocol,database}.md`),
proven in production for the S3/storaged agent
(`S3AgentService`/`S3AgentCommandService`, the shipped Go agent at
`s3.agent`). `docs/agents/database.md` explicitly designed the generic
`agent_commands` table to be domain-agnostic *anticipating* a future "backup"
agent type — this implementation walks through that door rather than inventing
a new protocol:

- **Envelope** (unchanged): `{v, id, type, agent_type, agent_uuid, timestamp, payload}`,
  `agent_type: "backup"`.
- **Subjects** (unchanged pattern): `agent.backup.{uuid}.cmd` (platform → agent),
  `agent.backup.{uuid}.evt` (agent → platform).
- **Auth**: `NatsAuthCalloutService::AGENT_TABLES` (in `NextDeveloper\Events`) maps
  `s3_backup_agents → backup` — one line added to an existing generic map, no new
  code path.
- **Bulk data path stays off NATS.** NATS is control-plane only everywhere in this
  system. The agent's embedded Kopia client uploads backup data straight to its
  dedicated bucket over HTTPS using a scoped IAM key — the same separation of
  concerns storaged already uses (NATS for control, the SeaweedFS S3 gateway for
  data).

### The one genuinely new piece: registration

Existing agent types (`vm`, `storage`, `compute`, `network`, `s3`) are
pre-provisioned — their member row and `agent_api_key` exist before the agent ever
starts, baked into a config-drive ISO or written at VM-creation time. That doesn't
work here: backup.agent runs on a customer's own arbitrary machine with no
pre-existing relationship to us. See `registration.md` for the token → register →
NATS-credentials handshake, modeled on the existing in-VM "Managed Services" agent
registration flow (`App\Http\Controllers\ManagedServices\AgentRegistrationController`).

### Scheduling runs agent-side, not platform-side

Jobs are scheduled and evaluated **on the agent**, not triggered by the platform on
a tick. A customer's machine may be offline, asleep, or unreachable at any given
moment — a platform-side scheduler can't know when it'll next be reachable, so the
agent owns its own cron loop and reports finished runs after the fact (see the
`job_run` message in `protocol.md`). The platform can still force an out-of-band run
via the `run_job_now` command (dashboard "run now" button), which *does* pre-create
the run record before the agent replies, since that path has a known start.
